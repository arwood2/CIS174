To Fix:
	Go through assignments and fix their wording so we are not having them create a massive project.
	For summer semesters, move the project stuff up earlier
	Maybe move the database work up earlier (??)
	Chapter 3 has unneeded bootstrap setup
	Maybe move GitHub earlier and require that for all projects (???)
